# Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program

This repo contains my workbook for both task 1 and task 2 of the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program. It is based on a case study about a particular retail store
and more specifically, the chips item cateogory within this retail store.

## Module 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
In module 1, we are given two datasets, chips sales and customer data. We are required to carry out exploratory data analysis and extract insights about purchasing behaviour 
in each of the customer segment.

## Module 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing
In module 2, we are told that there are 3 trial stores that have gone through a 3-month trial period with altered store layouts. We need to assess whether or not these changes
in store layouts have resulted in positive outcomes in terms of chips sales and number of customers who have purchased chips. In order to do this, we have to first assign a
control store to each of the trial stores. Once the control stores have been determined, we proceed to use statistical test like the t-test to evaluate the difference in total 
sales and number of customers between the control stores and the trial stores during the trial period and subsequently draw conclusion on the effectiveness of the trial.
